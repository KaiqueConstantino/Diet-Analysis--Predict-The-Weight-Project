Project Relatory:
🎯 Complete Machine Learning Project for Predicting Weight Fluctuations 🎯
🔎 About the Project: This machine learning project aims to explore and predict changes in weight from a diverse dataset with health and lifestyle characteristics. The dataset consists of 100 participants, and each of them contributed data such as age, gender, current weight, caloric intake, macronutrient composition, sleep quality, stress and physical activity levels.

📊 Data Exploration and Analysis (EDA)
I performed a detailed exploratory analysis to identify patterns and correlations between the data. It was possible to observe how each variable interacts with the others and influences weight, creating a solid basis for building predictive models.

💡 Implemented Models:
1️⃣ Linear Regression

Accuracy: We achieved an impressive 99.99% accuracy, showing how well the data aligns with a linear regression model for weight prediction.
2️⃣ Random Forest

We used Random Forest to model non-linearities and complex interactions, which complemented the predictions made by the linear model.
3️⃣ Neural Networks

Through a multi-layer neural network model, we investigate even deeper patterns. This model allowed for advanced analysis to capture more complex relationships between input variables and weight.
